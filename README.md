## Programs Included

### 1. Even or Odd Checker

**Purpose:**  
Determine whether a user-provided number is even or odd.

**Concepts Used:**
- Modulus operator (`%`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)

**Sample Output:**


---

### 2. Vowel or Consonant Checker

**Purpose:**  
Check whether the entered alphabet is a vowel or a consonant.

**Concepts Used:**
- Character comparison
- Logical OR (`||`) operator
- Case sensitivity handling

**Sample Output:**


---

### 3. Greatest of Three Numbers

**Purpose:**  
Find the largest number among three user-input values.

**Concepts Used:**
- Nested `if-else` statements
- Comparative logic

**Sample Output:**


---

### 4. Programming Language Chooser (Menu using Switch)

**Purpose:**  
Let the user choose a programming language from a menu using a number, and display the selected language.

**Concepts Used:**
- `switch-case` control structure
- Menu-driven program

**Sample Output:**


---

### 5. Simple Calculator

**Purpose:**  
Perform basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) between two numbers based on user-selected operator.

**Concepts Used:**
- `switch-case` statement
- Arithmetic operations
- Input validation (division by zero)

**Sample Output:**

## Conclusion

These mini C++ programs are ideal for beginners who are learning core programming concepts such as conditional statements, switch-case logic, arithmetic operations, and user input handling. Each program is designed to focus on a single logical task â€” from checking if a number is even or odd to building a basic calculator.

By practicing these examples, learners gain hands-on experience with decision-making structures and reinforce their understanding of syntax and logic flow in C++. These building blocks form the foundation of more complex programming tasks and are essential for progressing toward advanced C++ development.

This collection is a great starting point for students, educators, or anyone refreshing their programming fundamentals.
